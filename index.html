      Land Manifesto: Decolonizing Agriculture ⚘
    </div>

   
    <div id="one">
      In 1970, the South Korean government pushed for “the green revolution” under president Park’s authoritarian regime. Korea was in the process of transforming into an industrial society from an agricultural community and this transformation came with a globalization of the market and radically capitalized values.

      <span>The Green Revolution</span>
      <br><br>South Koran government was promoting chemical fertilizers, GMO’s, and foreign seeding/breeding technology heavily influenced by the west to compete in trade treaties such as UR(Uruguay Round), WTO(World Trade Organization), and FTA(free trade agreement). This aggressive development suddenly invaded our land and declared our practices as ‘primitive’. It threatened our ecosystem and food sovereignty. Female farmers of this agronomy community witnessed this alarming deterioration and decided they needed to take action. They started their own revolution, created a movement called Wooritutbat Project (우리텃밭 사업, Our land project). They continued the tradition of organic practice, focusing on biodynamic and indigenous farming methods. This significantly re-generated the land and promoted vibrant ecosystems for the soil, insects, animals, and microbes.

      <br><br>This farming revolution built its own food supply system from the ground up as well: organic, affordable, and community-focused/led. They established their own infrastructure, creating a direct transactional system between farmers and consumers. This model has been successful in terms of providing fresh, seasonal vegetables and crops directly to consumers. Also, it allowed farmers to take back financial ownership and food sovereignty in the market.

      <br>The mothers of our land knew when our land was being colonized and gracefully fought back and still continuing the fight. Through this research, I hope to honor Korean female farmers’ incredible resilience and carry the spirit in solidarity ❃

      Commercialization of food, mass-produced agriculture, and seeds that have been transferred as property of large corporates. GMO seeds are threatening farmers in the name of intellectual property rights and patents. Seeds trapped in royalty no longer belonging to this land.

      , also known as terminator technology or suicide seeds, is the name given to these methods that designed plants only germinate once to increase profits. 
      FI varieties, Terminator <a><sup>2</sup></a>  and Tractor, etc. are disposable seeds that farmers must purchase each year. 
      In addition, because of its limited vitality, it cannot survive without relying on chemicals, so it can only grow with appropriate pesticides.

      Land Manifesto
      <br>
      <br>
      Native seeds have been proven to have stable yields every year because the seeds and traits are indigenous to our land. 
      It will continuously produce and flourish by adapting to our land and climate. They are resistant to natural disasters and can be self-cultivated to ensure the safety of supply. 
      Native seeds will be the beginning of reviving agriculture and food sovereignty protection.
      We must replace seeds trapped in corporate royalties. 
      Our seeds will carry the experience of farmers and the knowledge of the rural community, enrich our food resources
      and pass it on to our future generations.

      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
